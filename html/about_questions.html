        </div>
        <div class="about-container">
          The first year students attending computer engineering at
          Oslo Metropolitan University are each year given a final project in the
          subject “Webprosjekt” where they are supposed to find a problem and present a
          solution to this problem. Six students came together and started working on the
          assignment by brainstorming different problems and solutions until the idea Flow was born.
          <br>
          <br>
          The subscription based newspaper service “Flow” is our solution to the future
          of online newspaper and access to information. Paywalls in the world of online
          news has become a standard in the last few years, and has been forcing people to
          commit to one or few paid news sources, if any at all. This is making it more
          challenging for people to be source critical and easier for the publishers to
          spread biased news.
          <br>
          <br>
          In the age of “fake news” this is our attempt of giving everyone multiple good
          and reliable news sources so they themselves can come to a informed conclusion
          and understanding of the world.

          What is Flow?
        </div>
        <div class="about-container">
          Flow is a subscription based service that gives the customer access
          to all the articles behind the paywalls of the newspaper companies
          that are under our service. We are looking to collaborate with more
          newspaper in the future. This includes both paid and free newspaper
          services.
        </div>

        <div class="questions-header">
          Why does Flow exist?
        </div>
        <div class="about-container">
          Many people read news online, but some articles are locked behind the
           distributors paid services. For example, VG have the paid service VG+.
          People must also go to different news sites to find different
          information. Some sites may focus on sport while others focus on economy.
          Flow exists to gather all news articles paid and free, and to give
          the people the option to sort by the news they want to see across
          multiple news websites.
        </div>

        <div class="questions-header">
        Will Flow improve their services in the future?
        </div>
        <div class="about-container">
          Yes! In the future Flow will strive towards implementing better
          translations of foreign news to the user's preferred language to expand
          the number of articles they can read. Flow will also expand the
          preference and sort sections to give the user a more tailored
          experience. For example, sort by most viewed, highest rated, most
          commented etc.
        </div>

        <div class="questions-header">
          What separates Flow from other similar sites?
        </div>
        <div class="about-container">
          Our aim is to gather news sites from around the world in
          one place. Providing much cheaper access to multiple news sources for
          the reader.
