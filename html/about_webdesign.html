          The first year students attending computer engineering at
          Oslo Metropolitan University are each year given a final project in the
          subject “Webprosjekt” where they are supposed to find a problem and present a
          solution to this problem. Six students came together and started working on the
          assignment by brainstorming different problems and solutions until the idea Flow was born.

          What is Flow?
        </div>
        <div class="about-container">
          Flow is a subscription based service that gives the customer access to all the articles behind the paywalls of the newspaper companies that are under our service.
          We are looking to collaborate with more newspaper in the future. This includes both paid and free newspaper services.

        <div class="questions-header">
          Why does Flow exist?
        </div>
        <div class="about-container">
          Many people read news online, but some articles are locked behind the distributors paid services. For example, VG have the paid service VG+.
          People must also go to different news sites to find different information. Some sites may focus on sport while others focus on economy.
          Flow exists to gather all news articles paid and free, and to give the people the option to sort by the news they want to see across multiple news websites.

          Yes! In the future Flow will strive towards implementing better translations of foreign news to the users preferred language to expand the number of
          articles they can read. Flow will also expand the preference and sort sections to give the user a more tailored experience. For example, sort by:
          most viewed – today, -week, -year. And adding show: cute, scientific, terror, pet articles.
        </div>

        <div class="questions-header">

          Flows goal is to gather sizeable news sites from around the world in one place. In contrast other sites focus on helping publishing
          smaller local newspapers in their respective places.
