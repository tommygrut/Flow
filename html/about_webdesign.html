          While creating this service, our priority was to make it as accessible as
          possible as we wish to include all segments of the society. Whether
          the user is blind, deaf or have other disabilities.
          <br>
          <br>
          Accessibility has been the focus of every decision made. From the color theme,
          navigation, structure, picture descriptions and general sizing of elements.
          The color theme was chosen based on being easy on the eyes, good contrast, color
          blind friendly and generally because blue is, according to color theory, a
          calming color. Navigation is made tab friendly, and always easy to
          navigate, no matter which page the user is on.
          <br>
          <br>
          In the current prototype, the articles on our web site can not be read by a text
          reader as these are screen shots. In the final product, this will not be a
          problem. We have made sure the web site will work regardless of web browser,
          screen resolution and all the main OS. In the finished product we will have a
          language selector that includes the most used languages, and hopefully more and
          more added as the user base grows.
          <br>
          <br>
          <b>Potential problems</b><br>
          There are some challenges regarding our service that we do not have an ultimate
          solution for, but we believe they are manageable.
          One of these challenges is the economical model as it may cause certain problems
          in regards to distributing the monthly subscriptions between the news companies
          without facilitating for click bait articles as this is something we want to
          avoid.
          <br>
          <br>
          <b>The future</b><br>
          Flow is an online service currently only available on internet browsers, but can
          easily fit in to an app interface. What we want to accomplish is to
          continuously expand by including as many serious and respected online
          newspapers into our service as possible.
          <br>
          <br>
          We hope that we in the future will be able to acquire a neutral team working to
          find exceptionally good and informative articles, and adding them to a
          recommended list.
          This team will also be analyzing articles to sort out and remove newspapers who
          frequently spread untrue information. Newspaper companies who continues to
          violate this rule may receive penalties.
          <br>
          <br>
          <b>What are the privacy implications for the design choices I made?</b><br>
          When registering at our website we have made sure to not ask for any information
          other than what is asked by other newspaper companies when registering at their
          site, and what is required for us to bill our customers.
          <br>
          <br>
          We expect the finished product to be fully up to date on security and safety
          standards in regards to personal information.
          <br>
          <br>
          We are keeping the same design throughout the website. This makes it easy to
          navigate the pages and

          The "Choose paper"-menu option in the "News"-section, allows the user to create
          their own custom made front page, consisting of their favourite newspapers.
          This will make a more stream lined user experience.
